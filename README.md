Android Game to Guess the names of famous celebrities

This app was made to demonstrate Advance String manipulation and Use of Asyn Task in Android.

In this project , We aschnronsly fetch the source code for https://www.imdb.com/list/ls052283250/
and manipulate the source to get the name and image urls respectively 

We then maintain two ArrayLists to keep the name and urls and pass the url for the question which fetches the image in background and displys it with 4 options .
